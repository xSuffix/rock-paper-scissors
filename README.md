# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a game where two players (or in this case one player and one computer) pick either rock, paper or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it.

This project aims to be a reference for trainees without much experience in web development. Therefore it is simple and the answers of the computer are random.
